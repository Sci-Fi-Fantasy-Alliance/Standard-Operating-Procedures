# Spoiler Policies

1. If in doubt, use spoiler tags! You add those by putting || on both sides of the spoiler or highlighting it and clicking on the eye.
2. All channels outside of the “Sci-Fi Fantasy Discussion” and “Book Club” categories are spoiler-free. If you're discussing a specific book, use spoiler tags or move to the appropriate channel.
3. The general-book-talk-📓 channel is also spoiler free and can be used to discuss book recommendations and reading orders in general, as well as spoiler free discussion of any book. For book recommendations, don’t forget to check out sffa-books-synopses, as well.
4. The fandom-specific channels in the “Sci-Fi Fantasy Discussion” category generally can have spoilers for all the books and related works of that fandom - but check the channel description to make sure!
5. In the “Sci-Fi Fantasy Discussion” channels only: If you want to discuss only a specific set of books, create a thread and state the spoiler policy you want as the thread title, then that spoiler policy is the valid one for that thread.
6. The book club category has:
    - a completely spoiler-free channel for those who haven't started the book yet.
    - multiple channels with spoilers up to a particular chapter of the book for those who are currently reading
    - and a full spoiler channel for those who've finished reading and the re-readers.

Each channel on the server also has the relevant spoiler policy listed in the channel description.
The  emoji in a channel name means that it's a spoiler channel.  in the channel name means that you need to hide any spoilers behind tags.

Newly released material can be discussed only under spoiler tags for one month after its first airing/publishing. This applies even in the fandom channels that are usually full spoiler! Special threads or channels will be made for the discussion of the new material instead.
