# Mod Responsibilities

1. Moderators need to ensure that their channels remain active weekly. This can be done through planned events, impromptu discussion topics being posted, or even just responding to other members.
2. Moderators need to ensure their channels (and the members using them) are in compliance with server and Discord rules and policies.
3. Moderators need to ensure that their channels remain on-topic, and when necessary direct members to other appropriate channels.
4. Moderators need to ensure that their channels are organized, with proper descriptions and update descriptions and pinned posts as necessary to keep channels tidy. They are also responsible for channel-specific announcements, if any are needed.
5. Moderators are the point of contact for their specific channel(s). See: References 02 - Areas of Responsibility
