# Mod Decision Hierarchy

1. Minor decisions, such as pinning a post, updating channel information for a channel that mod controls or giving a verbal reminder for basic things like channel topic or spoiler policy are done on the spot and do not need to be mentioned or discussed beforehand.
2. Minor rule-breaking actions are handled by the mod who sees the issue. After it is taken care of (verbal warnings, removal of rule-breaking posts, etc.) the mod posts about what happened in #mod-talk or #drama-channel to keep the rest of the team apprised of the situation.
3. Major rule-breaking actions should be posted in #mod-talk for discussion and then follow the 08 - Warning System.
4. Decisions that require a second pair of eyes or anything that youâ€™re not 100% sure about (and it is not time-sensitive) is posted in #mod-talk first and discussed with at least 1-2 other mods before being enacted. Mods can also use #brainstorm to discuss ideas and community suggestions.
5. For anything that affects the entire server, such as rule changes or updates to policies, a vote is required. Follow the Procedures: 05 - Handling Decisions-Polls for setting up a poll and having it voted on by the mod group.
6. For anything that requires a super-vote (such as policy updates to specific fandom channels, or how mods handle certain actions in the community), mods handle it as they do mod-only voting decisions, but then also post a poll for the community in #announcements.
