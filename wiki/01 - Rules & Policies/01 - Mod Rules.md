# Mod Rules

1. Mods should follow all server rules in every channel and be an example to members.
2. Mods should respond quickly to messages, even if it is to say they are busy.
3. Mods should make sure they are taking appropriate actions when necessary, including making sure the right level of decision is being made. (see 01-1 Mod Decision Hierarchy)
4. Listen to the community as much as possible and incorporate their suggestions, making sure to follow Rule 3 to do so.
