# Politics Policy

Relevant discourse, done in good faith is welcome. Popping into this server to go on a random political or religious rant that derails the conversation and creates any kind of heated argument, or develops into vitriol, is not.

We want this community to be inclusive, and so we, as mods, must make difficult choices and decide what can and cannot be said or discussed, or at least the level and context in which this kind of debate should be allowed. Respectful, good faith engagement in a discussion about politics that's relevant to the broader conversation in a channel is welcome. We encourage such debates, insofar as they provide opportunities for us to reflect on the current state of social affairs and relationships. But if the discussion develops into a heated argument, we might need to make the difficult decision that the topic has gone too far.

If it is our judgement that a conversation has crossed the line, or if other people report that they feel uncomfortable regarding the route a conversation has taken, we will have to step in and end the conversation completely.
