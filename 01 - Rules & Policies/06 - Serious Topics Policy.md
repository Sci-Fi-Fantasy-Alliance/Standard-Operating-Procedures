# Serious To

The ‚ùï rated channels can have discussion of some more serious or difficult themes.

This type of content is judged by mods on a case-by-case basis, you can contact us if you feel like a context-appropriate message got targeted unjustly. In general, when posting about sensitive topics, please follow the guidelines below:

- Graphic descriptions of both sex and violence are NOT allowed anywhere. If you really want advice on that torture scene in your fanfic - preface the link with a content warning. Do NOT post graphic quotes.
- The following topics can be freely (but respectfully) discussed in the channels of books that deal with them and have to be tagged everywhere else (refer to the description of each channel for guidance):
-- non-graphic descriptions/mentions of sex/violence/heavy injuries
-- potentially triggering/traumatic topics like suicide, abuse, non-consensual behaviour, etc
-- general grossness

In general just make sure to be tasteful and respectful while discussing sensitive topics and be understanding of other people. Imagine that a random person just joins the channel and your message is the first one that they see. What would it make them feel and think of the community here? Try to keep things wholesome.

Also, we understand that when chatting with people you know well, boundaries diffuse a lot. In that case just make a thread with content warning and continue there (consider that mods still have to read it, so have pity on our eyes and keep really disturbing stuff out of here).
When in doubt - err on the side of caution. If someone asks you to tag your message - please do, it costs you nothing, but will make the life of your fellow reader better.
