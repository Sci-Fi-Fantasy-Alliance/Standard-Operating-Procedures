# SFW Policy

First and foremost there is one main rule: be mindful of each other. This community was created in the spirit of collaboration and love for our respective fandoms, and we generally want to keep the atmosphere here positive and wholesome.

That being said, we do not mean to smother fun and make this place ~serious business~. Feel free to joke around as long as it's all in good fun and keeps with the spirit of the channel where you're posting.

Here are the channel specific policies:

- All channels are PG-13, unless marked otherwise. No explicit content is allowed, keep your innuendoes innocent. If you feel like you absolutely need to make that dark/raunchy joke - cover it under a spoiler tag with a [relevant warning] before it (and please keep the number of such jokes to a minimum). Violating this rule will result in warning, timeout or ban depending on the severity.

- The [`#❔2dark4general-📓`{: .bg-grey-lt-300}](https://discord.com/channels/959795934240309248/961282377659854938) channel is meant to be a more lax version of [`#⚪general📓`{: .bg-grey-lt-300}](https://discord.com/channels/959795934240309248/959795934240309251). We'll be turning a bit more of a blind eye to raunchy or dark content there, but explicit sexual content or any form of gore is still very much not allowed. Visit the channel at your own discretion.

- The [`#⚪general📓`{: .bg-grey-lt-300}](https://discord.com/channels/959795934240309248/959795934240309251) , [`#⚪pets-plants📓`{: .bg-grey-lt-300}](https://discord.com/channels/959795934240309248/961307502987845673) and [`#⚪obscure-hobbies📓`{: .bg-grey-lt-300}](https://discord.com/channels/959795934240309248/961305012645019648) channels, on the other hand, are meant to be particularly wholesome, so no dark humour, innuendoes or other similar content is allowed at all.

- Book-specific channels have different policies depending on that book's content, refer to the pinned messages in each channel, as well as the channel's description. Rating: `⚪`{: .bg-grey-lt-300} or  PG-13 (<- no icon) or `❔`{: .bg-grey-lt-300} or `❕`{: .bg-grey-lt-300}

For the channels with a `❕`{: .bg-grey-lt-300} rating, we'll be applying a special content policy, see the “Serious topics” section for details.
